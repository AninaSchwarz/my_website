## Teaching

My teaching philosophy is rooted in engagement, challenge, and inspiration. I derive immense satisfaction from guiding students through their learning journey and igniting their interest in subjects I am deeply passionate about.

I was involved in undergraduate and graduate teaching activities at the Universities of Freiburg, Harvard, Maryland, and Bern and have designed several courses. With my training in both quantitative methods as well as sociology and my proficiency in coding in R and Stata I am well-qualified to teach courses on statistics for the social sciences, computational social sciences, and social change. Other topics that are part of my teaching curriculum cover inequalities, ethnic and group relations, social networks, social institutions, terrorism and political violence, social movements, deviance and social control, opinion dynamics and social polarization, and digital societies.


Here are some selected courses I designed or helped co-designing.
