## Hello!

I am a sociologist and postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology](https://www.krim.unibe.ch), University of Bern. 




My research lies at the intersection of sociology, criminology, and political science. 

In my work, I pair tools from computational social sciences and standard statistical analyses to study **inequalities, trust and social cohesion, and resilience**. My current projects examine **topics and sentiments** related to the digital media discourse on contentious social issues and their consequences on public opinion, the **social networks and dynamics** that led to the emergence and evolution of extremist movements in contemporary societies, and the **impact of generative AI** on the resilience of democracies. 


I am a former fellow with Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center.  I was a fellow with the Harvard Kennedy School's Cyber Project (2020-2022), a Belfer Center International Security Program postdoctoral fellow (2018-2020), as well as a member of the Belfer's team that has built the National Cyber Power Index 2020 (downloaded more than 4,300 times). Previously, I held positions as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and as a graduate researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Foreign Criminal Law and Criminology in Germany (2013-2018).
I am a recipient of grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Fondazione Leonardo among others, and serve as a Board Member of the [Academy of Sociology](https://www.academy-sociology.net) as well as an elected member of the [Global Young Academy](https://globalyoungacademy.net).
