## Hello!

I am a sociologist and postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology](https://www.krim.unibe.ch), University of Bern. 



My research lies at the intersection of sociology, criminology, and political science. 

My work combines tools from the computational social sciences with standard statistical analysis to study **social norms, inequalities, and resilience**. My current projects examine the **topics and sentiments** associated with digital media discourse on contentious social issues and its impact on public opinion, the **social networks and dynamics** that have led to the emergence and evolution of extremist movements in contemporary societies, and the **impact of generative AI** on the resilience of democracies. 


I am a former fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School.  I was a fellow with Harvard Kennedy School's Cyber Project (2020-2022), a postdoctoral fellow with the Belfer Center's International Security Program (2018-2020), and a member of the Belfer's team that produced the National Cyber Power Index 2020 (downloaded more than 4,300 times).  Previously, I held positions as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and as a graduate researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Foreign Criminal Law and Criminology in Germany (2013-2018).
I am a recipient of grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the University of Bern, and the Fondazione Leonardo among others. I am a Board Member of the [Academy of Sociology](https://www.academy-sociology.net) and serve as one of the 200 elected members of the [Global Young Academy](https://globalyoungacademy.net). I am also affiliated with the [Swiss Centre of Expertise in Life Course Research](https://www.centre-lives.ch/en) and the [Digital Society Initiative](https://democracy.dsi.uzh.ch).
