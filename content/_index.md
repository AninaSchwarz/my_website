## Hello!

I am a political sociologist and criminologist at the [Institute of Penal Law and Criminology](https://www.krim.unibe.ch), University of Bern, and a research associate with the [Insitute of Sociological Research (IRS)](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/socio/recherche/irs/index/sociology-research-fund), University of Geneva. I study **social identities**, **social norms** and **digital technologies** and how they shape migration, discrimination and violence in democratic societies.

My current work combines theoretical insights with computational methods (machine learning, NLP, social network analysis) across three research areas:  
**Social identity representation**: I analyze how social identities are constructed and contested in digital discourse around contentious issues like extremism and political violence, and examine their influence on public opinion formation. **Democratic norms and artificial intelligence**: I study how societies adapt to rapid AI development, investigating whether these systems strengthen or undermine democratic norms and institutional practices. **Networks of political violence**: I examine the social network structures and relational dynamics that enable politically motivated violent groups to organize, coordinate, and achieve their objectives.

My research has been published in leading peer-reviewed sociology and criminology journals, as well as interdisciplinary journals, including *European Sociological Review*, *Crime and Delinquency*, and *PLOS One*.

I am a former fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School.  I was a fellow with Harvard Kennedy School's Cyber Project (2020-2022), a postdoctoral fellow with the Belfer Center's International Security Program (2018-2020), and a member of the Belfer's team that produced the National Cyber Power Index 2020 (downloaded more than 4,300 times).  Previously, I held positions as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and as a graduate researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Foreign Criminal Law and Criminology in Germany (2013-2018).
I am a recipient of grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the University of Bern, and the Fondazione Leonardo among others. I am a Board Member of the [Academy of Sociology](https://www.academy-sociology.net) and serve as one of the 200 elected members of the [Global Young Academy](https://globalyoungacademy.net). I am also affiliated with the [Swiss Centre of Expertise in Life Course Research](https://www.centre-lives.ch/en) and the [Digital Society Initiative](https://democracy.dsi.uzh.ch).
