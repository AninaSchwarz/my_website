# my_website

## How to update the website:

1. Navigate with the terminal to Documents/GitHub/Website/my_website
2. Type "hugo server -D", make the changes that I want and see how they are reflected
3. Once I am happy, type "hugo" to build my website. This will update the content of the folder /public
4. push the change to the github repo: "git add .", then "git commit -m 'message describing the update'", then "git push".
5. There is a continuous integration of the Github repo and Netlify, so normally I should not do anything else and the changes will be reflected on the deployed website.
